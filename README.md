# Portfolio

This is the source code of my portfolio. It is built in React and Typescript and I also made a Python Flask server to fetch my updated Github repository information to populate the projects section of my portfolio.

I initially made this portfolio in Flutter Web, but moved to React after learning it.

## 3 sources of inspiration!

1. [Tanush's portfolio](https://tanush.dev)
2. [Rafi's portfolio](https://rafibarash.com/)
3. [Frank's portfolio](https://jiafrank.com/)

## Next Steps

I need to figure out how to parse my Medium blogs and display that information on my portfolio.
